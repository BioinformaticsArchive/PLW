However, you can also supply your own similarity graph in the format of an edge list via a command-line option.\r\n\r\nThe core mining algorithm runs in O(|V| log |V| + |E|) time, where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges.\r\n\r\n### What's Available\r\n* Supplementary Materials (to be uploaded)\r\n* Predicted protein complexes (to be uploaded)\r\n* ZIP file containing Windows and Mac OS X binaries and sample data (to be uploaded)\r\n\r\n### References\r\nDaniel Lin-Kit Wong, Xiao-Li Li, Min Wu, Jie Zheng and See-Kiong Ng\r\n**PLW: Probabilistic Local Walks for Detecting Protein Complexes from Protein Interaction Networks**\r\nWorking Paper\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHave a question?
