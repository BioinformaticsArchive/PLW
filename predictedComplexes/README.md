Predicted Complexes
===================

Format of files
---------------
* Complex tab-delimited files
	* Each line represents one complex.
	* On each line,
		* the first number represents the numeric complex ID.
		* the second number (N) represents the number of proteins in that complex.
		* the following N strings are the names of proteins in that complex.

Contents
--------

* Contains predicted protein complexes for 12 algorithms applied to two yeast PPI datasets.
* Also contains predicted protein complex cores for PLW algorithm ("PLW-cores.txt").
